# A Universal Cryptography Protocol for Git

This project managed the new proposed standard for a universal cryptography protocol for Git. It is specified using the [Community Specification][0] developed via the [Joint Development Foundation][1], with inspiration from the [Open Web Foundation Agreements][2] and the [Alliance for Open Media Patent License 1.0][3].

The inspiration for this work came out of two mentorships hosted by Hyperledger at the Linux Foundation in summers of 2019 and 2020. This specification was made possible in part by the hard work of Irahim el Rhezzali and Jimit Bhalavat.

## Status

[ ] Update the prototype patches to adhere to this specification.
[ ] Submit the patches and specification for review.
[ ] Incorporate feedback.
[ ] Merged and released.

## Repository Contents

* The specification is in [Git Cryptography Protocol.md][4].
* Instructions on how to contribute are in [Contributing.md][5].
* Our code of conduct is in [Code of Conduct][6].
